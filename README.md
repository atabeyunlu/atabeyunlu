<h1 align="center">Hi ðŸ‘‹, I'm Atabey</h1>

I'm a Machine Learning Researcher at BioDataLab with expertise in AI-driven solutions for biotechnology and drug discovery. I have Msc in Bioinformatics, combined with hands-on experience in developing generative models and utilizing natural language processing architectures for drug discovery and molecular property prediction. Currently, I am working on optimizing large generative models for molecule and protein design.
